            WARNING: YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY CHARGES IF YOU PAY OFF A FIXED RATE

          <p className="font-weight-bold">Fixed Rate Loans</p>
          <p>
            Whenever (i) repayment of a loan in full or in part is made or (ii)
            with the agreement of permanent tsb, the loan is switched to a
            variable rate loan or other fixed rate loan, before expiry of the
            Fixed Rate period (hereinafter called the “Early Termination”), the
            applicant shall, in addition to all other sums payable as a
            condition of and at the time of the Early Termination, pay a sum
            equal to the permanent tsb’s estimate of the loss (if any) arising
            from the Early Termination. In the calculation of the said loss,
            permanent tsb shall endeavour to apply in so far as it is fair and
            practicable.
          </p>
          <p>This is how the fee is calculated;</p>
          <p>C = (I-S) x R x (M-T)/12</p>
          <p>
            “C” is the charge to compensate for the loss (if greater than 0),
          </p>
          <p>
            “I” is the swap/market fixed interest rate for the term of the Fixed
            Rate Period at the date of its commencement,
          </p>
          <p>
            “S” is the swap/market interest rate for the remaining fixed period,
          </p>
          <p>
            “R” is the amount of the Fixed Rate loan balance paid or switched at
            the date of Early Termination,
          </p>
          <p>“M” is the fixed Rate Period (in months) and,</p>
          <p>
            “T” is the time expired of the Fixed Rate Period at the date of
            Early Termination (in months).
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a worked example; “I” = 5%, “S” = 3%, “R” = €100,000, “M” =
            24 months, “T” = 12 months.
          </p>
          <p>C = (5%-3%) x €100,000 x (24-12) / 12</p>
          <p>So, C = 2% x €100,000 x 12 / 12</p>
          <p>C = €2,000</p>
          <p className="font-weight-bold">Valuation</p>
          <p>
            A valuation must be carried out on the property you intend buying
            and a valuation fee must be paid. The maximum valuation fee is e130
            which includes VAT but excludes valuer’s travel expenses. The
            valuer’s travel expenses are: 1-10 miles = Nil; 11-20 miles = 6;
            21-25 miles = 8. Properties incomplete at the time of the original
            valuation will require, on completion, a final valuation, the fee
            for which is €65 which includes VAT but excludes travel expenses.
            Additional loans will require an Opinion of Value (“drive by”
            valuation) the fee for which is €65 which includes VAT but excludes
            travel expenses. The valuation fee is refunded if the application is
            not accepted.
          </p>
          <p className="font-weight-bold">Legal Fees</p>
